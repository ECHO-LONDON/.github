# Echo

Social media used to be social. Nowadays, it's a battleground for attention, with algorithms deciding what we see and when we see it. This has led to a situation where we are constantly bombarded with content that we don't care about, and we are missing out on the content that we do care about. This is a problem that we are solving with Project ECHO.

ECHO is a web3 social media aggregator platform that helps disillusioned users gain control of their own feed algorithms through "finding their people." Users connect their social media platforms and explicitly select their interests, and ECHO aggregates content across these platforms to create a customized feed.

Users engage with the content by marking what they like or dislike, enhancing the app's understanding of their preferences. This process not only refines their feed over time but also earns them tokens and progresses them towards unlocking an exclusive community feature. 

The community aspect is at the heart of ECHO, connecting users with others who share similar interests and values. This feature ensures that users not only see content that aligns with their preferences but also discover enriching content that broadens their horizons.
